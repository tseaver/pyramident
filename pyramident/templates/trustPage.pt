         Beware, if you release information to them, they are likely

         that they are.</p>

     <p> The site <tt>${trust_root}</tt> has requested verification
         of your OpenID.  I have failed to reach it and thus cannot
         vouch for its authenticity.  Perhaps it is on your local

         implement OpenID 2.0's relying party verification mechanism.
         Please use extra caution in deciding whether to release
         information to this party, and ask <tt>${trust_root}</tt> to
         implement relying party verification for your future
         transactions.</p>
